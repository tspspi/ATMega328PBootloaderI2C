# I2C Bootloader for ATMega328P

This is an I2C bootloader for the ATMega328P using the same AVR-ISP protocol
as Arduino is using over the serial port.

Note that this code does compile but has __never been tested__!

The bootloader has been written from scratch but was heavily inspired by
the Arduino ATMega168 bootloader.
